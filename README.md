You are looking for a crypto dev to help buidl your idea or you're looking for a team to join? You've come to the right place! Crafting together is much more fun, so let's find you a team.

## Hacker looking for a team

You **have skills** and **want to find a team**? Great:

1.  Open a new issue using the template `Hacker wants team`. Here you can introduce yourself and tell potential teams why you're awesome. Feel free to add or create labels that match your skills.
2.  Browse all open issues with the label `looking-for-hackers` or `creating-new-team`.
3.  If you find a team with an idea that excites you, start engaging with the team. You can just comment in the issue. You should reference the issue from step 1 here, so that the team can learn a bit more about you.
4.  When you found a team please close your issue so that people know you have found a team.

## Team looking for a hacker

You **have a team** and **want to find more crypto dev**? Amazing:

1.  Open a new issue using the template `Team wants you`. Here you can pitch what you're working on and tell everyone why they should buidl it.  Feel free to add or create labels that match your skills.
2.  Wait for hackers to approach you or browse through the hacker profiles (all issues with the label `looking-for-team`) and engage with them.
3.  When you found all the hackers you dreamed of and needed close your issue so that everyone knows you're set.

## Communication

Interacting through issues might be great to find an initial match, but you probably want to take the conversation off GitHub at some point.  Join the dev chat room on Slack: [undefined]
